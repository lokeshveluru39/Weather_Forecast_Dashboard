# 🌤️ Weather Forecast Dashboard – Power BI
This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to visualize and analyze weather forecast data. It provides an interactive and intuitive interface to explore temperature trends, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation for multiple locations over time.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed
- Sample weather dataset (CSV/Excel or connected via API)
- Basic knowledge of Power BI (loading data, DAX, visuals)

## 📁 Installation & Setup Steps

# 1. Clone the Repository:
    bash
    Copy
    Edit
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecast-dashboard.git
    cd weather-forecast-dashboard
# 2. Open the Power BI File:
    Launch Power BI Desktop
    Open the .pbix file from the cloned repository

# 3. Load or Refresh Data:
    If using a local dataset (e.g., CSV or Excel), update the file path in Power Query Editor
    If connected to a weather API, ensure internet access and valid API credentials (if required)

# 4. Customize Filters or Locations:
    
    Use the slicers to filter by:
    Date range
    City/region
    Weather conditions

# 🚀 Running the Dashboard

Once the .pbix file is open and the data is loaded, the dashboard is ready to explore. Use interactive charts and slicers to:
  
    View daily and weekly forecasts
    Compare temperature, humidity, and wind speed
    Identify weather patterns over time and location

## ⚙️ Optional Configuration

# If using API-based data:

    Navigate to Transform Data → Advanced Editor
    Replace placeholder API keys or endpoints
    Set up a scheduled data refresh (optional via Power BI Service)

🔧 Common Issues and Solutions
* Data Not Loading or Missing
* Check the file path or API source in Power Query
* Ensure column names match the ones expected by the visuals
* Broken Visuals or Errors in Measures
* Validate DAX formulas in the Model view
* Ensure all expected fields are available in the data model
* Slow Performance
- Reduce the number of visuals or rows displayed
- Use summarized tables or aggregation techniques
